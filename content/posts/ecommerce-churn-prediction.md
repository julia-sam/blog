In this post, I explore and analyze some e-commerce customer data by identifying patterns in customer satisfaction and churn. 

The dataset used for this analysis includes information on customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and satisfaction scores. Key features include:

#### CustomerID: 
Unique identifier for each customer.
#### Gender: 
Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
#### MaritalStatus:
Marital status of the customer (Married/Single/Divorced).
#### PreferedOrderCat:
Preferred order category of the customer (e.g., Fashion, Grocery, Mobile).
#### SatisfactionScore: 
Satisfaction score given by the customer (1 to 5).
#### Complain:
Whether the customer has made a complaint (Yes/No).
#### Churn:
Whether the customer has churned (0 for no, 1 for yes).
